# TrendPartner
Trend Partner is a React app built using Ant Design. It is an ecommerce website that allows users to buy clothes for men, women, and children. The app has a header, main content area, and footer. The header contains the logo, navigation bar, and search bar. The main content area is where the products are displayed. The footer contains contact information and social media links. The data for the products is fetched using a dummy JSON file. React Router DOM is used for routing.

Here are some of the benefits of using Ant Design to build Trend Partner:

Ant Design is a well-designed and well-documented UI library. It provides a wide range of components that can be used to build beautiful and functional user interfaces.
Ant Design is highly customizable. You can easily change the look and feel of the app by changing the colors, fonts, and other settings.
Ant Design is easy to learn and use. Even if you are not familiar with React, you can quickly get started with Ant Design.
